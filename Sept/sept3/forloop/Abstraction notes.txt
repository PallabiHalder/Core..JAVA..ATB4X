In Java Abstract is the keyword. 
Remember, abstract can be a class or method both.

- If the class doesnâ€™t have any abstract method, then it is a concrete class.

Abstract class cannot be final.

- An abstract class cannot be instantiated i.e. one cannot create an object of an abstract class.

- Although it is not required, an abstract class may have the declaration of one or more abstract methods.

- Since the body of an abstract method cannot be implemented in an abstract class.

- Non-abstract/normal methods can be implemented in an abstract class.

- To use an abstract class it needs to be inherited from.

- The class which inherits from the abstract class must implement all the abstract methods declared in the parent abstract class.

- An abstract class can have everything else as same as a normal Java class has i.e. constructor, static variables and methods.

- You cannot use the following modifier with abstract methods:

Private,  static,  final, strictfp, synchronized,  native.
