/*

 Note :  when u execute the code lets say when i = 1, i =2,i = 3 and i =4.........
when i = 15 then if u put fizz or buzz in the first condition then since 15
is also divided by 3 and else if statement will never take the
value which is already satisfied with the previous condition and
 thats why when u try to print fizz buzz which i%3 or i%5 i.e nothing
  but i%15 ==0 it will never able to detect 15 as it is already booked
  by 5 or 3 which is also a factor of 15, Hence you should use fizzbuzz
   in the top to avoid such missouts.
